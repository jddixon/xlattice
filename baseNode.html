<p>An XLatticie <strong>BaseNode</strong> is a set of information common to a number
of XLattice abstractions including
<a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/node.html">Node</a> and
<a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/peer.html">Peer</a>.</p>

<p>A BaseNode has</p>

<ol>
<li>a <strong>name</strong>, a convenience for testing; it need not be unique (although
it is better if it is)</li>
<li>a <a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/nodeID.html"><strong>nodeID</strong></a>, a 20-
or 32-byte value, which should be globally unique</li>
<li>an RSA key for use in encrypting small messages, its <strong>commsKey</strong></li>
<li>a second RSA key used for signing documents, its <strong>sigKey</strong></li>
<li>a number of <a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/overlay.html"><strong>Overlays</strong></a>
though which it communicates</li>
</ol>

<h2>NodeID</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/nodeID.html">NodeID</a>
is a 160- or 256-bit value, typically generated by SHA-1 or SHA-256,
where SHA is the Secure Hash Algorithm.  It is not unreasonable
to hash one or both of the node&rsquo;s <strong>public</strong> RSA keys to generate its nodeID.</p>

<h2>CommsKey (ck)</h2>

<p>The RSA algorithm limits messages to something less than the key size,
so a few hundred bytes.  RSA is also compute-intensive and so quite slow.
Given these considerations, RSA is normally used only to set up a session
and then a much faster block cipher such as AES is used to encrypt the rest
of the session traffic.  If the session is long-lived, the session key
might be renegotiated every hour or so.</p>

<p>In this approach, one XLattice node (acting as the server) will publish
its RSA public key.  Another XLattice (actign as a client) will use this
public key to encrypt a message which can only be decrypted by the server,
using its RSA private key.  In a short exchange, the two will agree on a
block cipher session key.  All further messages are encrypted using that
session key.</p>

<h2>SigKey (sk)</h2>

<p>It is widely believed that it is less safe to use the same keys for both
encryption and digital signatures.  So the XLattice node has two RSA keys,
the commsKey described above and then a second key, the sigKey, used for
generating digital signatures.</p>

<p>Standard practice is to make an XLattice node&rsquo;s nodeID and the public
parts of the commsKey and sigKey available to all prospective Peers,
so that the comms public key can be used to encrypt the secret message(s)
used to initiate sessions and the sig public key can be used to verify
digital signatures supposedly created using the server&rsquo;s sig private key.</p>
