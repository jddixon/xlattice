# XLattice Acceptor

## XLattice Transport

XLattice
[Nodes](https://jddixon.github.io/xlattice/node.html)
communicate by sending messages over connections.  The primitive 
notions common to all XLattice connections are

* **Acceptor**, an EndPoint on which a Node listens
* **Address**, a sequence of bytes distinguishing EndPoints
* **Connection**, a pair of EndPoints enabling communications between
  the Nodes at either end
* **Connector**, an address and other information necessary to establish
  a connection to another Node
* **EndPoint**, an address and a Transport
* **Transport**, a name identifying a communications protocol

### Acceptor

An Acceptor is an EndPoint on which a Node listens.  On receiving a
connection from a far Node, the Acceptor will either reject it or begin
the procedure necessary to establish a connection.  Usually this
involves

* creating a data structure including at least the details of the
  initiating Node
* starting a separate thread or coroutine which will be responsible
  for handling the commuication, in particular the first message
  which the far Node sent to begin the session

An Acceptor should normally be capable of handling some arbitrary 
number of connections, possibly a system-imposed limit.
